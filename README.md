# DC_Real-World-Simulation

## Project 2018 - Simulate a real world phenomenon

### Project tasks:
Choose a real world phenomenon and collect at least one-hundered data points 
across four variables
Investigate the types of variables, their likely distributions and relationships
with each other
Simulate a dataset closely matching their properties
Detail research and implement simulation in jupyter notebook

### Project structure and points
Project functionality in Github was used to plan tasks and store references as Project was being completed

Bibliography contained in the jupyter notebook is a reference to articles/ sites visited or where a direct quote was used

### How to view Project/ run notebook
The Project was produced in a jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) that can be downloaded to your personal computer and run in jupyter notebook. It can also be viewed in Github.

The code was written in python using the Anaconda distribution platform.

### Project Plan
- 18 November - 24 November - create notebook and research dataset for simulation
- 25 November - 01 December - write up introduction research variable distribution
                            - **project change due to unavailability of data for           hypotesis**
- 02 December - 08 December - investigate distribution of new variables
- 09 December - 14 December - investigate relationships and create dataframe
